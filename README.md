Graph Representation
---
This C++ program reads a graph with n nodes and m edges, and stores it as an adjacency list (used for efficient graph representation).

It uses a vector of vectors to store connections for each node.

For every edge input (u, v), it adds v to uâ€™s list and u to vâ€™s list â€” assuming it's an undirected graph.

ðŸ§  One-liner:
This code creates an adjacency list representation of an undirected graph using vectors in C++.
